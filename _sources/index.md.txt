<h2> Mission </h2>

I maintain open source software for Pythonâ€™s data ecosystem.

I do this to increase accessibility to computation and in so doing accelerate science and inform policy decisions for the broader public.

<h2> Current Work </h2>

I am primarily known for [Dask](https://dask.org), a library for scalable computing with dynamic task scheduling.

I also run a startup company [Coiled](https://coiled.io).

I work on projects that make research and education more effective, efficient, inclusive, and transparent. I also believe that it's important for open source technical projects to have healthy and inclusive _communities_ behind them.
